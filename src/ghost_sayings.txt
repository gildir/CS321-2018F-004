I'm a Boogie Woogie ghost, I'll take the item that you like the most!
Lions and Tigers and Bears oh my, you're a GMU student but who cares go cry!
What do mummies like listening to on Halloween? Oh you don't know! WRAP music! Give me your Iteeeeeem!
Scary-go-round" and rollerghoster? One item please!
The rain is dampening my spirit, rock-paper-scissors I'm gonna win it!
If you give me an item I won't be a pain even though you can see through me!
If you give me an item I'll give you the ghost's favorite dessert ... I SCREAM!
I'm working on my ghoulish figure so I hope your item is healthy!
Boo unto others as you would have others boo unto you. Remember the golden rule!
Playing this game with you is so boo-ring, but I'll still take your item!
This is unboo-liveable, I won again!
You're a CS major? I wouldn't even let you be my Face-boo friend!
You look like you just saw a ghost!
Rock-paper-scissors game is fine, but I would rather play Hide and Shriek!
Don't boo-hoo now just because you thought that CS321 would be easy!
Oh you're lost!? Where is your TA now!? BOO-HAHAHAHAHAH!
You can complain about me on PIAZZA, but you know that everyone will ghost you!
Oh you're trying to trick or treat? Well if you don't run away, this might be the last candy you'll ever eat!
So you're saying CS321 is a writing-intensive class, well I can be your ghost writer!
It won't be so funny for you when you realize I don't dress up like this just for HALLOWEEN!
