                You walk up to Brent, who is hunched over his laptop and
		busily typing away. You quickly tell him how the changes
		from last sprint got deleted, and he is going to have to
		rewrite them all.

		"I'll get on that, I've just got to finish this method for
		Sarah first."

		It appears that Sarah called him and strong armed him into
		doing the work that she wanted done, even though it wasn't
		assigned for this sprint. Your team appears to be backed
		up on both last week's and this week's sprints.

		You should talk to Patty to get a plan together to get all
		your stories done on time.
