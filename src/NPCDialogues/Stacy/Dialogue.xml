                You tell her that you are searching for a Kanban Board.

                "What! I don't know who told you that we have those here, but
                you're sadly mistaken. And if we did, I wouldn't give it to
                you. Get out of here before I call security!"

                Not the best reception, but from what Erik said, you know they
                have one. Try asking again

		You insist that she has a Kanban Board, and tell her that Erik
		told you about it.

		"Of course! I should've known. I'll have a word with Erik, but
		just because you know about it doesn't mean you can have it."

		Closer, but it appears she won't budge on this. You'll have to
		find another way in and take it yourself.
