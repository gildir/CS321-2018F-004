		<intro>
		You walk up to Sarah, who is busy tapping away on her IPhone.
		You start to ask why she deleted your code, when she
		interrupts you and says,

		"My team is still waiting for your team to implement Ghoul so
		we can do our features, but for some reason your team keeps
		on dragging your feet. Maybe you're not prioritizing
		correctly? Or maybe you're just not used to supporting a
		project this important?"

		Before you can reply, Steve calls you over to discuss your
		project timeline.
                </intro>
		<cont>
		No more time to talk, Steve wants to talk about the project
		timeline.
