		<intro>
		You find a security guard in an office of MRP-8. You get ready
		for a fight, but he doesn't seem to be angry.

		"Let me guess, you're looking for a Kanban Board. 3 times this
		week people have come through looking for a Kanban Board! I
		tell the company, hey, we could make bank selling these things,
		but nope. Anyways, I'm sick of working in this place. It's too
		efficient, too organised. I'll get you that Kanban Board if you
		can get me a job. Deal?"

		It sounds like a great deal to you, but where are you going to
		find a job? It's not the sort of thing people just drop on the
		ground...

                <done>
                You give the guard a job, and he thanks you and gives you a
		Kanban Board! You should let Erik know that you found one. Be 
		careful, because you only have 1 Kanban Board!
