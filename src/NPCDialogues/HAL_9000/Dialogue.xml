                You ask your HAL_9000 to submit a pull request for your
		work.

		"I'm sorry boss, I'm afraid I can't do that"

		"What's the problem?" You ask.

		"I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do."

		Merge conflicts! There's only one option left! Go beat three of
		your classmates in rock-paper-scissors to get them to close
		their pull requests so yours can go through without conflicts.

                "Have you beaten your classmates yet?" HAL asks. "I could
		just delete their code to avoid the conflicts"

		Tempting, but you decide to be the better man. Go find and beat
		3 other players in Rock-Paper-Scissors.
                </cont>
		<done>
		You got your pull request accepted, and merged succesfully!

		A few hours later, HAL informs you of the bad news. Some fool
		named Sarah has deleted all of your changes, just so her pull
		request could get through! Go find her and give her a piece of
		your mind!
