		<intro>
		You find Chris sitting by the Chick-fil-a. You walk up to him
		and begin to discuss you problem. He agrees that Sarah is a
		problem, but had no difficulties with his pull request. He
		agrees to have better communication, but you need to do some
		research for him in return. He wants you to poke the ghoul 10
		times and observe its reaction.
		</intro>
                <cont>
		You have not poked the ghoul 10 times yet. You should probably
		do that before you talk to Chris.
                </cont>
		<done>
		You tell Chris what you have learned about the Ghoul. He thanks
		you, and agrees to have better communication in the future.
		Additionally, he tells you of this man named Erik, who
		supposedly knows the secret to getting your group to funciton
		perfectly. You should find him and figure it out.
