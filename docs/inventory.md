# Items and Inventory - Team 1

## Items in CSV - Feature 501 - Saru
### User
All the items available in the game can be accessed by the following .CSV file:
[Items in .CSV file](./src/items.csv).
Each item is denoted on the file with its name, followed by the associated weight, price, item Discription, and flavor text. The values represented in the .CSV reflect exactly the object properties of that item in the game. 

### Developer
The .CSV file from above is utilized in 
[Item reading](./src/GameCore.java).
A .CSV file (comma-separated values) is a file structured in a way such that values are delimited with commas and line breaks. This helps when reading input from the file. Each line will represent another item, and the line can be tokenized into separate values per item by taking advantage of the commas. If more items are desired, then the .CSV file can be edited by adding a new line and entering the information of the item in the name, weight, price order, discription, flavor (without spaces in between the commas).

## Item Object - Feature 502 - shull4
### User
Items in the game are bundled together to hold the item's name, weight, price, discription, and flavor. These are all contained in a single item.  When you look at a item, the weight is given to you in paranthesis.

### Developer
The overall item object is located at
[item](./src/Item.java)
The items are custructed as a basic java object holding a string, two double values, then two more strings.  The constructor takes the values of these variables as parameters to create the object.  Functions avalible to the item object are to set and get all variables and a toString to print the item out (name and weight). Items can easily be expanded to hold other values. 

NOTE:  This is a deviation from the original core of the game, where items were labeled as Strings only.  The Strings representing items were changed to Item objects for the game inventory, the player inventory, and all assosiated calls to player functions that search for and returned Item Strings. This includes:  Pickup, Look, Inventory, and the random student drop.

## Item Drop Table and Master List - Feature 502 - shull4
### User
- This section is not required to be altered by the user.
### Developer
[Items in .CSV file](./src/items.csv)
The items for the game drop table are listed in the .CSV file above.  The items can be expanded on or subtracted from in .CSV form.  The .CSV file starts with the first row being a heading for the colloums.  The first colloum is the item name in the form of a String, the second colloum is the item weight (pounds) represented as a double, the next colloum is the item price (for the store) as a double, the next colloum is item discription as a string, and the final colloum is the item flavor as a string. The items must be written in this order, as it is hardcoded into the item read. Additional items may be added or current items may be removed, as long as all the fields for each item or added completely or removed completely. No blank lines are permitted in the .CSV.

Item reading can be found in 
[Item reading](./src/GameCore.java)
This code is written to read the Item name, weight, value, discription, flavor (String/double/double/String/String).  This then constructs a new item object and adds it to the overall game drop table arraylist.


## Item Weights - Feature 503 - Saru
### User
The weights associated with each item is located in
[Items in .CSV file](./src/items.csv)
The weights for an item are determined by a generic category of light, medium, or heavy. Light items all have the weight of 0.5. (for example, Gum and Phone would have the same weight of 0.5). Medium items like a Textbook or a Backpack are given weights of 5 or 10. A much heavier item like a Dog or a Human may have weights of 100 or 200. While the unit for weights are not pounds, the value of weight for an object indicates the general category the object would fall into for light, medium or heavy. Items can be sorted by weight during the game, if the user wishes to arrange their inventory from heaviest to lightest or lightest to heaviest is also available.

[Example of inventory with weights](./sprint_3_images/Weights.png)

### Developer
To edit the weights, the developer only needs to change the first value after the comma following the relevant object's name. To change/manipulate the weight property of the object, first study the item object class.
[item](./src/Item.java)
The weight is read from the .CSV and represented as a double. It can be accessed by the getWeight() function, which returns the double value of weight. A changeWeight(double weight) method can be used to set the weight.

[Item reading](./src/GameCore.java) 
This code is written to read the Item's name, weight, and price (String/double/double).  This then constructs a new item object and adds it to the overall game drop table arraylist.  The heading row of the .CSV file is consumed and discarded. Any deviation to the item attributes (either adding or removing attributes) must be accounted for in the hard coding of reading the .CSV. 

Reading the .CSV uses java.util scanner, java.io exceptions, and java.io file. java.util arraylist was used to store the items into the game item drop table.  These were imported into [GameCore](./src/GameCore.java)

NOTE:  If there is any IO error, the default item list will be loaded into the game drop table. This is found in the catch of the .CSV reading. Reading of the .CSV was a deviation to the original game code. The original item table is loaded in the case of an IO error. Additionally, the games drop table was changed from a static array to a arraylist. 

## Inventory Size Limit - Feature 504 - Mike
### User
Players inventory has been decreased from infinity to 10.
### Developer
The code for the inventory is located in [GameCore](./src/GameCore.java) under the String pickup method. An if statement restricts pickup to the inventory being less than 10, once 10 items in the inventory is reached, the pickup feature defaults to failure.

## Dropping items - Feature 505 - Jae-Moon Hwang
### User
In order to use the drop feature, it is very similar to the pickup feature. The keyword `drop` must be followed by an item name (e.g. `drop flower`). If there are multiple items of the same name, then only the first instance of the item is dropped.
### Developer
The code for the drop feature is very close to the code for the pickup feature. When a player initiates a drop, the name of the player and the name of the item are used as parameters. The parameters are passed through the drop method in GameCore. The method looks up which room the player is in and then tries to remove the named item from the player's inventory. If the named item is not found, it simply tells the player that they do not have any number of the named item. If an instance of the named item is found, then it removes the first instance of the named item from the player's inventory and tries to add it to the room's inventory.

## Offering an Item - Feature 506 - Mike
### User
Users are not able to offer an item to other players. Simply type `O` or `Offer`, target player's name, and name of item to offer (e.g. `Offer Player1 Sword`) and request will be made. The item is removed from your inventory until player either accpets or rejects your offer.

Players are not able to offer to someone not in your room, yourself, or players not in the game. Also, you are unable to offer items not currently held in your inventory.
### Developer
The code for the offer feature is located in GameCore and has many checks for validity. Checks for valid offer target, target player be co-located as offer initiator, and item being currently held by initiator. If any checks fail, the item is returned to the players inventory and the offer is cancelled.

## Trade Feature, Single Instance - Feature 509 - Mike
### User
A new trade feature is put into the game allow players to be engaged in one trade at a time. Trades are initiated and accepted/declined in real time and while in a trade, no other offers or requests can get through. To initiate a trade, follow directions in the menu or simply type `R_Trade Playerx`. Players will be prompted to accept or decline a trade and upon completion, can engage in new trades or gameplay.
### Developer
Code is implemented to request and accept/reject trade request within game. The methods used are `requestPlayer` and `playerResponse`. Requests and responses are issued by players to initiate trades. Players will have their `setInTrade` flag tripped while in a trade and it will be reset once trades are finished. Use of `getReplyWriter` to get responses from other players is used. Trade flags will be shell and logic code for the offer/accept/reject methods further in the game.

## Using items and gaining titles -  Feature F02 - Jae-Moon Hwang
### User
In order to use an item, use the keyword `use OBJECT`. When using an item, the game will use the first instance of the object in your inventory reading left to right. When used, the player will gain a title for a set amount of time which after they will lose their title.
### Developer
The use feature is fairly straight forward. When a player uses an item, the game will try and remove the first instance of the item from the player's inventory. It will then return that item which will be used to get the title. The title is then attached to the player for a set amount of time. Time is kept in `GameClient.java` for the titles. Every time a player makes an action, there is a check whether `startTime` has been initalized to anything other than 0. This checks both the time passed and whether a player has a title as `startTime` is only not 0 when an item has been used. If the time elapsed is greater than the set time, then the player's title is removed. Time is kept track and gotten by `java.lang.System.nanoTime()`.

## Sorting player's inventory - Feature F03 - Jae-Moon Hwang
### User
In order to intiate a sort on a player's inventory, use the keyword `sort`. Once initiated, the player will have the option to sort by three categories: name, weight, and price. After selecting the category, the player is then asked if they want to sort in an ascending order or descending order.
### Developer
The sort feature has a few pieces to its code. When the player initiates a sort, the player will be prompted on their client to sort by categories and ascending or descending order. The input is then concatenated into one string of two letters as both the category and order are indicated by one letter each. This string represents the mode of the sort and passes the string through the client to the sort method found in the Player class. If the user does not provide the correct format for sorting, the game will keep asking until it obtains valid inputs from the user. Name, price, and weight are sorted using their own comparator and can be found in the Player class. Name is sorted in lexicographical order based on java's String compareTo method. Both price and weight are sorted using normal means which are comparing the actual numerical values and using operators for comparison.

## Examine Items - Feature F05 - shull4
### User
In order to examine a item and see its discription, the item must be in your inventory. The keyword `examine` must be followed by an item name that is in your inventory. If there are multiple items of the same name, then the first item in your inventory list is examined.  The user can type help to get information on this command.  If a item is not in your invetory, you will be prompted as such. 
### Developer
The examine feature obtains the string from the user input and retreves the calling players inventory.  The inventory linked list is then searched sequentially for an item with a matching string name to the inputed name by the user. This search ignores case.  If the search is completed and no match is found, a string is returned prompting the user.  If the string is found, the discription string from the item object is extracted and returned. Code for the examine function can be found [here](./src/GameCore.java).

## Rathskeller Bottle - Feature F07 - shull4 and Jae-Moon Hwang
### User
There exists an item named Rathskeller Bottle. When used, every player message will be lower cased and then randomly upper cased. Additionally, all punctuation will be changed to ! or ? randomly. This effect will last for a minute.

### Developer
When the Rathskeller Bottle is used, a flag is triggered on the player for a minute. This is done with a thread that sleeps for 60 seconds then makes the flag false. Say, Whisper, Reply, and Joke are all affected. There is a helper method in GameCore.java that translates the player's message.

## Refuse Items - Feature 508 - Saru Kalva
### User
To refuse items, the user must choose the option to reply_offer or r_offer and follow this with either the keyword 'reject'. This can only be done if the player has been made an offer made by another player, and offers are only allowed once a trade has been setup, meaning one of the players involved in the trade have requested and accepted one another. Only one trade is allowed at a time. A refused offer will result in no change to the player's inventory. The current, unchanged inventory will be displayed to the user so they are aware. If the player accepts the offer that has been shown to them, their inventory will lose the item that was requested by the other player and will gain the item that they have been offered. Their new inventory will then be displayed to the user.

### Developer
A refused offer in handled in the offer method within GameCore.java. Several checks are performed to make sure it is allowed for a player to refuse an offer. They have to be currently in a trade, an attribute that can be accessed in Player.java. Their trade partner's name will also be stored as String attribute and, in the case that they are in a trade, it will not be null and instead filled with the name of the player they are trading with. If they have been offered an item by the other player, the flag for tradeRequested in Player.java, which has heretofore been false after the trade was cleared to begin, will be changed to true, meaning an offer is on the table and has been displayed to the user. The trade item they have been offered is also stored and can be used to manipulate the inventories of the relevant players.
